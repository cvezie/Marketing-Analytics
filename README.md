# Marketing-Analytics

For this project I looked at the acquisition of a small company, 'Y',  by another small company, 'Z'. I am most interested in looking at how Y was functioning prior to the acquisition. 

- How many clients did the company have and what information was the company compiling from which I can gain information?
- How productive was the company? How did their client base change?
- What is the analysis of the company's take rate?
- Is a new interface statistically more profitable for the company?
- What was the effect of a change in marketing strategy?
